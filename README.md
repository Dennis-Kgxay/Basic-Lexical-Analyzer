Lexical Analyzer Assignment for COMP-3050 (Programming Languages)

1. The lexical analyzer should identify:

    a) alphanumeric lexemes as IDENT token
    
    b) numeric token as INT_LIT token

    c) all others (‘+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’, ‘\’, ‘)’, ‘(‘) as separate tokens.

    d) Any symbols other than the above will throw an error.
